It's a pretty basic browser extension tbh;
download the file folder,
go to your extensions manager in your browser (press the puzzle piece icon then manage extensions),
turn on developer mode,
press load unpacked,
then select the folder.

It should work after that.

It creates a small popup on the bottom-right corner of the screen with the word count; press it to copy. You can also click and drag it across the screen.

I gave it permission to work on royalroad by default; it isn't really going to do anything if it isn't in a royalroad chapter.
